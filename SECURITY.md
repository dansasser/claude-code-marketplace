# Security Policy

I take the security of my plugins seriously. I appreciate any and all efforts from the community to find and responsibly disclose security issues in my projects.

## Supported Versions

I am actively developing and maintaining the plugins in this repository, including `claude-ollama-agents`.

For the most up-to-date and secure version, please always use the latest commit from the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub Issue for a security vulnerability.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to me privately by [suspicious link removed].

I will do my best to:

  * Acknowledge your report as soon as possible.
  * Keep you updated on the progress of any fix.
  * Credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep my projects and their users safe.
